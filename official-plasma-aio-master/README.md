A highly opinionated boilerplate that is extremely customizable for starting projects with Electron and React!

This boilerplate was made for beginners who don't want to worry about set up, and for my fellow obsessive compulsives that love to have full control of their project!

## About
This boilerplate uses:
[Webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/),
[Babel 7](https://babeljs.io/),
[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) ([Airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) style guide),
[Prettier](https://prettier.io/),
[Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/),
[SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/),
[PostCSS](https://postcss.org/),
[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/),
[React](https://reactjs.org/),
and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) (with [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/).

To top it all off, I added hot reloading with [React Fast Refresh](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-refresh)!
